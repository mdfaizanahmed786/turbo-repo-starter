Turbo Json is the file, where it can orchestrate the build system
It will build the pipeline for the project

@repo can be of any name it may be your project name as well. @repo/ui will be another ui project as well.
It can be common in all package.json files but it will still detect the @repo/ui folder.



In order to share things between multiple projects in the frontend or the backend, you need to create a separate folder like common in packages folder, then you need to tsconfig.json if necessary and an index.ts and you can enter some code there


Now, suppose you want to import that code in the backend project, you need can import there.


but before that you need to exports in package.json of common module that you are exposing this code to some external module/project.

You can have some dependencies issue or some package issue, you need to use esbuild in order to transpile ts code to js code.
